**PID-Project**
This project is done by two process, which are PID controller implementation and coefficients tuning

### PID controller implementation
* The code are mainly converted from python code in the classroom with some minor modification. 


### Coefficients tuning
* Coefficients are manually tuned so far. The car can drive within the lane but with some minor oscillations.
* In the future, Twiddle algorithm can be used to tune the parameters.
